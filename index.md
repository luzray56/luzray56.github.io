# Personal Project

Over the summer, I worked with a partner to create a COVID-19 app to keep track of your social interactions, or those who are in your "social bubble."
Each time you meet up with someone, you can scan each other's QR code to log the time of the interaction. You can log your COVID test results, which will allow
our system to notify others if they might be potentially in contact with COVID-19. A video link is included to demo our product (link will be updated soon).

## Teaching

I am excited to be a tutor for Data 8 this semester! If I have any class resources, I will link them here. 

## Piano

I have been playing the piano since I was 5. I passed the DipABRSM exam in 2017. I am currently not pursuing an active career in music, but it's not an option I've ruled out yet!
Some of my favorite pieces in include: Bach's Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue, Beethoven's Sonata Pathetique, Chopin's Nocturne in E flat, and Gershwin's "I've Got Rhythm."
