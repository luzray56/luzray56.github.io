## Personal Project

Over the summer, I worked with a partner to create a COVID-19 app to keep track of your social interactions, or those who are in your "social bubble."
Each time you meet up with someone, you can scan each other's QR code to log the time of the interaction. You can log your COVID test results, which will allow
our system to notify others if they might be potentially in contact with COVID-19. A video link is included to demo our product. We used React Native to write our code and handled our data storage with Google Firestore. Note: this project was created in August 2020 before the launch of CA Notify which has similar features.

### Piano

I have been playing the piano since I was 5. I passed the DipABRSM exam in 2017. I am currently not pursuing an active career in music, but it's not an option I've ruled out yet!\
Some of my favorite pieces in include:
- Bach's Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue
- Beethoven's Sonata Pathetique
- Chopin's Nocturne in E flat
- Gershwin's "I've Got Rhythm."
